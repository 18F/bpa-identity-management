**8. Basis of Award and Evaluation Criteria**
---------------------------------------------

This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart 8.4,
Federal Supply Schedules. This is not a FAR Part 15, Contracting by
Negotiation, procurement. All contractor submissions in response to this
RFQ are considered quotations and not proposals or offers, even if
labeled as such. The Offerors agree to and are bound by all
instructions, procedures and rules of this RFQ. The Government is not
obligated to determine a competitive range, conduct discussions, solicit
final revised quotations, and use other techniques associated with FAR
part 15. The contracting techniques associated with FAR Part 15 do not
apply.

The final award for this requirement will be based on best-value
principles, utilizing the trade-off process. Accordingly, award will be
made to the responsible and technically acceptable Offeror whose
quotation provides the greatest overall value to the Government, price
and other factors considered.

This best-value determination will be accomplished by the value of the
differences in the technical factors for competing offers under
consideration in the technical evaluation, based on their strengths,
weaknesses, and risks, with differences in their price to the
Government. The Government will make award to the Offeror with the
greatest strengths, fewest weaknesses, and least risk to successful
performance of this task.

The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical and
management capabilities than with making awards at the lowest overall
price to the Government. However, the Government will not make awards at
a significantly higher overall price to achieve slightly superior
technical value. Offerors are advised that the technical evaluation
factors combined are significantly more important than price.

### **a. Technical Evaluation Factors**

The Government will evaluate the requirements for an Offeror’s
performance or capability acceptability based on the following
non-price technical factors which are of equal importance to each
other.

-   Technical Understanding and Approach

-   Staffing Plan

-   Similar Experience

### **b. Price Evaluation Factors**

 Each Offeror’s price quotation will be evaluated separately from the
technical quotation. The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s
proposed price to ensure that the offered price is fair, reasonable,
and realistic. Pricing shall reflect reasonableness, consistency with
industry standards, and be in compliance with rates and terms and
conditions of the BPA.

#### **9. Evaluation Process**

a.  Evaluation Process

The Government intends to utilize a multi-phased approach for this
procurement as described below. To be considered for award, Offerors
must successfully pass through each phase.

**Phase 1**: Quote Compliance Check. A compliance check will be
conducted to ensure that offerors include a complete price quotation
in accordance with Section 7(c) and a technical quotation within the
page limit requested.

**Phase 2:** Technical Compliance Check. Review of Written Technical
Quotations to ensure that offerors meet technical requirements as
outlined in Section 7(b)(ii) and Section 7(b)(iii) of the RFQ, and the
PWS.

**Phase 3:** Code Test and Oral Interview Phase. Offerors that are
considered in Phase 3 will be notified of the time and date of the
oral presentations and code test. The code test will be focused on the
Offerors experience and skill with DevOps, infrastructure, and
continuous deployment methods.

The Offeror’s responses to questions asked during the Oral
Presentations will be evaluated based on an assessment by the
Government technical evaluation team of their strengths, weaknesses,
and risks associated with the technical factors described above. After
each oral presentation, the evaluation team will assess the technical
merits of their proposal and select the vendor that demonstrates, in
GSA's determination, the greatest understanding of the Government's
requirements as described in the PWS, has the proper mix of technical
expertise to satisfy the requirements, and does not exhibit weaknesses
that would significantly affect the vendor's ability to satisfy the
requirements.

Following the technical evaluations, price will be introduced and a
best value decision will be made in accordance with the Basis of Award
and Evaluation Criteria as identified above.

The Government does not intend to use any adjectival ratings for this
procurement and will provide a brief explanation in accordance with
FAR 8.405-2(d).
