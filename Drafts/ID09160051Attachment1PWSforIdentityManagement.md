Consumer Identity Management is a problem the Government has tried to
solve in a number of ways over the past decade. 18F and a team across
the government is now tasked with launching a new solution by November
2016. Our efforts are clearly described [on our
blog](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/05/10/building-a-modern-shared-authentication-platform/)
and further detailed in [Executive Order
13681](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/10/17/executive-order-improving-security-consumer-financial-transactions).

In addition, our current public work is available at [this GitHub

2.0 OBJECTIVES
--------------

The overall objective of the 18F Identity Management Project is to
develop a comprehensive identity solution for government agencies, using
a combination of custom built and commercial products. This particular

#### **5.6.4. Quality Assurance**

The Government will use the attached draft Quality Assurance
Surveillance Plan (QASP) to monitor the Contractor’s performance. The
QASP will provide oversight help to ensure that service levels reach and
maintain the required levels for performance of this task. Further, the
QASP provides the COR with a proactive way to avoid unacceptable or
deficient performance, and provides verifiable input for the required
Past Performance Information Assessments. The QASP is a living document

Before award of this task order, Offerors shall provide a signed
Organizational Conflict of Interest statement with their quotation
submission, if applicable, which describes concisely all relevant facts
concerning any past, present, or planned interest (financial,
contractual, organizational, or otherwise) relating to the work to be
performed under the proposed task order and bearing on whether the
Offeror has a possible organizational or personnel conflict of interest
with respect to:

1.  Being able to render impartial, technically sound, and objective
    > assistance or advice, or

2.  Being given an unfair competitive advantage.

The Offeror may also provide relevant facts that show how its
organizational structure and/or management systems limit its knowledge
of possible organizational conflicts of interest relating to other
divisions or sections of the organization and how that structure or
system would avoid or mitigate such organizational conflict.

No task order award shall be made until any potential conflict of
interest has been neutralized or mitigated to the satisfaction of the
Contracting Officer. The contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer
in writing as soon as any conflict of interest is identified and will
propose steps for mitigating the conflict.

Refusal to provide the requested information or the willful
misrepresentation of any relevant information by an Offeror shall
disqualify the Offeror from further consideration for award of a task
order under this solicitation.

If the Contracting Officer determines that a potential conflict can be
avoided, effectively mitigated, or otherwise resolved through the
inclusion of a special contract clause, the terms of the clause will be
subject to negotiation.
