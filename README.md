# Agile BPA Task Order - Identity Management Scrum Team
Procurement Package for the Agile BPA buy for the identity management team

Consumer Identity Management is a problem the Government has tried to solve in a number of ways over the past decade. 18F and a team across the government is now tasked with launching a new solution by November 2016. Our efforts are clearly described on our blog and further detailed in [Executive Order 13681](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/10/17/executive-order-improving-security-consumer-financial-transactions).

In addition, our current public work is available at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/18F/identity-idp).
